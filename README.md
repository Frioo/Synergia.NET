# This project is being re-written for better code style, stability and general ease of use.  
## It is advised to use this API for testing purposes only, since the new version won't be fully compatible.

# Synergia.NET
C# REST API for Librus Synergia

Please note this is **NOT** an official API...
*but it still has some neat features :)*
## Status
Synergia.NET is currently under heavy development but when a milestone is reached this section will be updated.

Current work is documented in the [issue section](https://github.com/Frioo/Synergia.NET/issues).
## Usage, documentation
For now, you can see example usages of almost all available methods in the [example test project](https://github.com/Frioo/Synergia.NET/blob/master/SynergiaCLI/Program.cs).  
***TODO:*** *update this section, create a wiki.*
